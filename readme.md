# Demo applications showing different .Net technology capabilities

> Since keeping all demos in same repo is difficult for users to download the new demos will be uploaded to [https://github.com/dotnet-demos](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet-demos/repositories) organization.

> Each demo will be its own repository there instead of folder in this repository.
